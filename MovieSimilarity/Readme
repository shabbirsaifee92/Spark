Item-based collaborative filtering

Implemented movie-recommendation algorithm using cosine similarity model.
@Given: A movieID
@Returns: Movie names which are similar to the given movie based on user ratings.

Possible improvement on existing algorithm:
1. Can filter out the data based on low ratings earlier in the transformation.
2. Higher similarity score to movie pair that belongs to the same genre.
